## Features

---
- **Automatic Type Inference**: Enjoy seamless type safety with automatic TypeScript inference.
- **Isomorphic Architecture**: Fully compatible with both server and browser environments.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Lightweight and efficient with no external dependencies.
- **No Configuration Needed**: Plug-and-play design requires no setup or configuration.


## Installation

---
NPM:
```bash
npm install @collect.so/javascript-sdk
```

YARN:
```bash
yarn add @collect.so/javascript-sdk
```

PNPM:
```bash
pnmp add @collect.so/javascript-sdk
```


## Usage

1. Get API Token at [app.collect.so](https://app.collect.so/)
2. Install `@collect.so/javascript-sdk`
3. Build something ~~people~~ you want:

```typescript
import Collect, { CollectModel } from '@collect.so/javascript-sdk';

const CollectInstance = new Collect("API_TOKEN")

// Push any data to Collect the way you perceive it
await CollectInstance.records.createMany({
  label: "PRODUCT",
  payload: [
      {
         title: 'T-Shirt',
         price: 50,
      },
      {
         title: 'Sneakers',
         price: 135,
         SIZE: [
            {
              uk: 8.5,
              qty: 5
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
})

// Find it with granular precision and without any query language
await CollectInstance.records.find("PRODUCT", {
    where: {
        title: { $contains: "Sneakers" },
        SIZE: {
            uk: { $gte: 8, $lte: 9 },
            qty: { $gt: 0 }
        }
    }
})
```

### Example with data modeling

```typescript
import Collect, { CollectModel } from '@collect.so/javascript-sdk';

const CollectInstance = new Collect("API_TOKEN")

const UserRepo = new CollectModel(
  'USER',
   {
      name: { type: 'string' },
      rating: { type: 'number' },
   },
  CollectInstance
);

await UserRepo.create({
   name: "John Galt",
   rating: 100
})

await UserRepo.find({
   where: {
     rating: { $gte: 50 }
   }
})
```



## How this achieved?
Collect achieves its flexibility through a unique hybrid approach to data storage by harnessing the capabilities of 
Neo4j's graph database, extending beyond its original features. This approach combines the
strengths of a strongly typed graph on one hand while offering the flexibility of saving data within the built-in
mechanisms of dynamically extending graph structures on the other.

Internal algorithms, including customized BFS (Breadth-First Search) and batching techniques, are intentionally crafted
for efficiency and speed. Their primary goal is to provide an outstanding user and developer experience, ensuring smooth
and high-speed operations throughout the platform.

In this documentation, you will find comprehensive information on how to use Collect to its fullest potential,
from getting started to advanced features.
