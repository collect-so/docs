# Introduction

Welcome to Collect, a powerful all-in-one data-warehouse and API-first solution that designed to streamline and 
improve data management to meet the complex data storage needs of modern applications and data-analysis challenges.

Collect allows to efficiently store and retrieve data
without the need for complex processes like normalizations, type definitions, scheming, or migrations. It ensures high 
availability, making it suitable even for handling large datasets and ambitious projects.

Collect adopts an API-first approach, ensuring that every piece of data is readily accessible through robust,
dynamically generated APIs, instantly available to empower your applications. Additionally, Collect provides suggestions
for data types and effectively maps them onto the graph, enhancing data management and retrieval capabilities.

## How this achieved?
Collect achieves its flexibility through a unique hybrid approach to data storage by harnessing the capabilities of 
Neo4j's graph database, extending beyond its original features. This approach combines the
strengths of a strongly typed graph on one hand while offering the flexibility of saving data within the built-in
mechanisms of dynamically extending graph structures on the other.

Internal algorithms, including customized BFS (Breadth-First Search) and batching techniques, are intentionally crafted
for efficiency and speed. Their primary goal is to provide an outstanding user and developer experience, ensuring smooth
and high-speed operations throughout the platform.

In this documentation, you will find comprehensive information on how to use Collect to its fullest potential,
from getting started to advanced features.
