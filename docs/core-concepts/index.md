# Intro

Collect serves two primary objectives:

1. To significantly reduce costs in rapidly changing API development requirements, especially in startups where time 
matters. It does this by using semi-strong typed graph structures to make data normalization completely automated. 
It also lets you build powerful, fast and reliable APIs by mapping data to instantly assigned endpoints.

2. To consolidate meaningful data into a singular repository, providing a unified platform
for both API development and granting accessibility to developers, data analysts, sales managers, and decision-makers. 
This platform offers a dashboard where collected data can be comprehensively interpreted to cater to diverse business needs.

Both of these objectives are realized through several essential components integrated into Collect's core:
